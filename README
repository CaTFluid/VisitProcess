// created 12/201/2013; Version 5: we may also deal with continuous file id, if we specify the first id = -1
// created 09/05/2013; Version 4:  we also calculate the distance of that family of springs at each level
	1) level is defined by initial level: (0- nZ);
	2) we only care about the distance:
        3) family id: 0-> raidal (for int); 1-> circular; 2-> axial
	4) apply to uniform mesh size




// created 05/23/2013, to read/dump multiple layers of one structure into the file
// created 04/05/2013, to read VTK file with all the information and dump to the *pts
// input: what part of node we should keep: start_id, end_id;
	  What is the connectivity: mesh_info: aixal_node, circular_node (by default, we only keep 1 layer)
// output: *.vtk -> *_inner.pts(points of inner layer)  and *_inner.area(points of outer layer)
	for file
// notice we use #to give comment follow that script
